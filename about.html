                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Previously I was working at a bunch of Retail Environments including Customer Service, Cashier and Restaraunts until
                    the pandemic hit and my company closed down shortly after lockdown.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When lockdown lifted I found it hard to get back into Retail so I decided to look into different options.
                    That's when an opportunity arose for me to take a course in coding so I took it and found out I had a talent and love for coding.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My first course was a beginners course from Codenation in Python, HTML and CSS, I enjoyed that and was instantly hooked so I started looking at other courses.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That's when I joined a masters course also from Codenation in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I made a bunch of projects on the course in both Frontend
                    and Backend design and that's when I decided I wanted to change my carrer from Retail into something to do with Coding.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So since then I've been on the hunt for a Junior Developer Role in coding. I have also been watching a bunch of stuff on youtube
                    and branching out into other languages such as C#, C++ and .net.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also in my spare time I am an avid Video Gamer and my ultimate dream goal is to work or even design my own Video Games</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So on this site I will post some projects I've done that are not games related in the project section but in the minigames section
                    I will post some projects I work on during my free time that are gaming related.
